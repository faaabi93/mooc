# [Java Programming - MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

This repository contains my solutions for the MOOC - Java Programming I online course.
Created by the [University of Helsinki](https://java-programming.mooc.fi).  

The repository for the Java Programming II course can be found [here](https://github.com/faaabi93/mooc-java-programming-ii).

The certificate, which one gets after completing the course, can be seen and validated [here](https://certificates.mooc.fi/validate/07vootsiqj0d).

[The University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/) is the oldest and largest institution of academic education in Finland. Through the power of science, the University has contributed to society, education and welfare since 1640.

  

## Course Contents

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, and we recommend reserving at least 10 hours per part, depending on prior skills with computers.

Both courses (see next paragraph) are an equivalent of 5 ECTS (6-week course).

## Notes  
Sometimes the exercises only contained a single file.  
For better readability I copied the files into an directory containing all the files of the respective parts.  
This is the reason IDEs show errors, when "running" a file.   

  

Also: Sometimes, when I got stuck while completing my exercises, I looked up other people's solutions. 
Thats why you are here, maybe.  

But the point in doing the MOOC is the learning itsself. If you only care about a certificate, then go ahead and copy my solutions to hand them in. But you won't learn a bit by doing so. The part that lets you learn things is the struggling and thinking. Not only while programming, but also in life.
