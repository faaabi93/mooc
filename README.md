# [Java Programming - MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

This repository contains my solutions for the MOOC - Java Programming online course.
Created by the [University of Helsinki](https://java-programming.mooc.fi)  

   ![enter image description here](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/illustrations/logos/university-logo.svg)  
[The University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/) is the oldest and largest institution of academic education in Finland. Through the power of science, the University has contributed to society, education and welfare since 1640.

  

## Course Contents

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, and we recommend reserving at least 10 hours per part, depending on prior skills with computers.

Both courses (see next paragraph) are an equivalent of 5 ECTS (6-week course).
